Van's experimental JS library.

I realized months ago the importance of a proper MVC framework to rich FE web projects. And since little education of programming was received, I do have problems understanding or using other mature frameworks, such as the great "backbone.js".

Then I started to think that maybe there can be another way to deal with the MVC. Well, with 90% confidence I can say that my framework won't be as good as existing ones in universality or completeness. However, I do believe this framework is adequate for light weight FE interactions. Afterall, what I'm dealing with is not yet too fancy or too complicated. It's just tiring to rebuild similar data objects, DOM objects, regular actions over and over again with plain jQuery.


What can it do
-

1. Build data object with basic query algorithms
2. Connect data object with DOM structure (DOM object and templates)
3. Assign actions in pattern (such as show and hide, render and clean, etc.)
